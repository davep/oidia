# OIDIA

## Introduction

OIDIA is a simple terminal-based streak tracker, written in Python using
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

By simple I *mean* simple. There's no shaming and streak counting and all
that stuff; it just lets you record what you've done, what days you've done
it on, and how many times you did it on those days.

That's it.

No judgement.

## TODO

It's currently a work in progress and the following still needs to be done.

- [ ] Saving progress (that'll happen before I reveal this)
- [ ] Reorder streaks.
- [ ] Delete streaks.
- [ ] Add a help screen.
