# OIDIA ChangeLog

## v0.2.1

**Released: 2022-12-12**

### Fixed

- Pinned to Textual 0.5.0 until
  https://github.com/Textualize/textual/issues/1343 is resolved.

## v0.2.0

**Released: 2022-12-08**

  now using the arrow keys does the more obvious thing.
- Improved what happens to focus when the timelines are (un)zoomed.

### Fixed

- Newly-added streaks are now created showing the current timespan, not the
  default one. ([#1](https://github.com/davep/oidia/issues/1))
