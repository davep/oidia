# OIDIA ChangeLog

## v0.2.0

**Released: WiP**

### Changed

- Dropped the use of <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd> to shift the timeline,
  now using the arrow keys does the more obvious thing.
- Improved what happens to focus when the timelines are (un)zoomed.

### Fixed

- Newly-added streaks were created with the default time span, not the one
  the user was using at the time.
